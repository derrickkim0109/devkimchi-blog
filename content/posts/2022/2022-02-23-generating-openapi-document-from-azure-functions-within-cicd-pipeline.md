From time to time, you might be facing some situations while using the [Azure Functions OpenAPI extension][az fncapp ext openapi] for your [Azure Functions][az fncapp] development. One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with [Power Platform][pp] or [Azure API Management][az apim]. What if you want to do this process within your CI/CD pipeline?

* [Publishing OpenAPI Document from Azure Functions to Azure API Management within CI/CD Pipeline][post 2]


Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.

> **NOTE**: Let's use the sample app provided by the [Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension][az fncapp ext openapi] repository.

First of all, you need to install the [Azure Functions Core Tools][az fncapp core tools] within your GitHub Actions workflow. Installing the tool varies depending on the runner OS. The command you're going to run the function app is like this:

```powershell
func start
```

If it's the terminal environment on your local machine, just open one terminal session and run the function app. After that, you can open another terminal session for additional command-line jobs. That's not a problem at all. However, it's a totally different story when it's about the CI/CD pipeline because you can't open multiple terminal sessions there. Therefore, you have to run the function app as a background process.


## Bash Shell Background Process ##

Bash shell offers `&` to run your app as the background process, like `func start &` (line #2). Therefore, you can run the shell commands to get the OpenAPI document like:

```powershell
# Run the function app in background
func start &

# Send request to the function app and save it to swagger.json
curl http://localhost:7071/api/swagger.json > swagger.json

# Read swagger.json
cat swagger.json
```

How simple is that?


## PowerShell Background Process ##

If you prefer PowerShell, use the `Start-Process` cmdlet with the `-NoNewWindow` switch to run the function app as the background process (line #2). For example, here are the commands on **non-Windows** runner:

```powershell
# Run the function app in background
Start-Process -NoNewWindow func @("start")

# Send request to the function app and save it to swagger.json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri http://localhost:7071/api/swagger.json | `
    ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100 | `
    Out-File -FilePath swagger.json -Force

# Read swagger.json
Get-Content -Path swagger.json
```

On the other hand, the `Start-Process` cmdlet doesn't understand the command, `func` on the Windows runner. Therefore, you need a pre-process the `func` command (line #2, 5).

```powershell
# Change the function app runner from .ps1 to .cmd
$func = $(Get-Command func).Source.Replace(".ps1", ".cmd")

# Run the function app in background
Start-Process -NoNewWindow "$func" @("start")

# Send request to the function app and save it to swagger.json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri http://localhost:7071/api/swagger.json | `
    ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100 | `
    Out-File -FilePath swagger.json -Force

# Read swagger.json
Get-Content -Path swagger.json
```

Now, you can get the OpenAPI document in PowerShell.


## GitHub Actions Workflow ##

Now, we can get the OpenAPI document from the function app running as a background process. It means that you can get the document within the CI/CD pipeline. Here's the example in the GitHub Actions workflow. It only shows the function app build and OpenAPI document generation (line #26-33) for brevity.

```yaml
name: Build

on:
  push:

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    name: Build
    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'

    steps:
    - name: Build solution
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
        pushd MyFunctionApp
        dotnet build . -c Release -v minimal
        popd
    - name: Generate OpenAPI document
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
        cd MyFunctionApp
        Start-Process -NoNewWindow func @("start","--verbose","false")
        Start-Sleep -s 60
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri http://localhost:7071/api/swagger.json | `
            ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100 | `
            Out-File -FilePath swagger.json -Force
        Get-Content -Path swagger.json -Raw
        cd ..
```

So far, we've walked through how to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app running as a background process within the CI/CD pipeline. The generated document can be stored somewhere as an artifact and integrated with other services like [Power Platform][pp] or [Azure API Management][az apim]. In the [next post][post 2], I'm going to discuss how to publish the pipeline-generated OpenAPI document to Azure API Management.
